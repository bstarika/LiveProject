# Live Project
## Introduction:
I was able to gain real-world experience during the Live Project at The Tech Academy. We worked on a MVC Web Application, utilizing both front / [back-end development](#back-end-development) and agile methodologies. It was a two week sprint, and during that time I was able to complete four stories and participate in daily standups - including a code retrospective. Our team used Azure Devops for the project, Visual Studio as an IDE, and Slack for communication. Thanks to the final project, I now can confidently navigate Visual Studio and understand the importance of Git/Version Control. I know how to resolve merge conflicts, create branches, push code, create pull requests, how to update the local master branch, and so much more.
## Back-End Development:
### Helper Method
My first story consisted of writing a helper function that was used to limit the number of characters that were displayed using ellipses. I created a static method in a C# class that took in a string and an integer. The string was the content that we were trying to truncate and the integer represented how many characters were allowed before cutting off the string and adding ellipses ( . . . ). I had to test my method in the Index page to ensure it worked before submitting.

Testing the helper method by setting the int limit to 50.

### Entity Model and CRUD Functionality
For this story, I had to create an entity model for the CastMember class so that cast members could be saved to the database. There were 3 parts to this story. I had to create the model for CastMember, an enum for positions, and then CRUD functionality.
