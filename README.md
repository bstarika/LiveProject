# Live Project
# Introduction
I was able to gain real-world experience during the Live Project at The Tech Academy. We worked on a MVC Web Application, utilizing both front / back-end development and agile methodologies. It was a two week sprint, and during that time I was able to complete four stories and participate in daily standups - including a code retrospective. Our team used Azure Devops for the project, Visual Studio as an IDE, and Slack for communication. Thanks to the final project, I now can confidently navigate Visual Studio and understand the importance of Git/Version Control. I know how to resolve merge conflicts, create branches, push code, create pull requests, how to update the local master branch, and so much more.
