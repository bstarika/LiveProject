# Live Project
## Introduction:
I was able to gain real-world experience during the Live Project at The Tech Academy. We worked on a MVC Web Application, utilizing both front / [back-end development](#back-end-development) and agile methodologies. It was a two week sprint, and during that time I was able to complete four stories and participate in daily standups - including a code retrospective. Our team used Azure Devops for the project, Visual Studio as an IDE, and Slack for communication. Thanks to the final project, I now can confidently navigate Visual Studio and understand the workflow for clean Version Control. I know how to create branches, update the local master branch, push code, create pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, and so much more.
## Back-End Development:
### Helper Method
My first story consisted of writing a helper function that was used to limit the number of characters that were displayed using ellipses. I created a static method in a C# class that took in a string and an integer. The string was the content that we were trying to truncate and the integer represented how many characters were allowed before cutting off the string and adding ellipses ( . . . ). I had to test my method in the Index page to ensure it worked before submitting.

Testing the helper method by setting the int limit to 50.

### Entity Model and CRUD Functionality
There were 3 parts to this story: Creating a model for CastMember, an enum for positions, and CRUD functionality. <br>
Below I created an Entity Model for the CastMember class so that cast members could be saved to the database. The "?" indicates the property is nullable. I also created a Position Enum for the Main Role.

Scaffolded Cast Member with CRUD functionality - a code generation technique to allow for database access.
